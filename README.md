## Code Style formatting

We use Google Java Style for code formatting. To install it, see the instructions below.

### VS Code

1. Install the [Checkstyle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-checkstyle) extension.
2. Use the `java-google-style.xml` file in the `docs` folder as the Checkstyle configuration file.

### IntelliJ

To add GoogleStyle formatting in IntelliJ go to `Preferences -> Editor - Code Style -> Java`. From Schema `Import Schema` and select file `docs/java-google-style.xml`
Once added, you will be able to reformat code using GoogleStyle. This can be triggered from the Code menu or with the `Ctrl + Alt + L` shortcut (default).
